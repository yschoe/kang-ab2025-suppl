# Kang et al. Adaptive Behavior 2025: Supplementary Materials

These are supplementary video files for the following article:

William Kang, Christopher Anand, Jin Hyun Park, and Yoonsuck Choe, Evolutionary Factors Contributing to the Emergence of Prediction, *Adaptive Behavior*, 2025 (in press). (The full reference will be updated when the article is published.)

For archival purposes, the contents below are frozen as of Sat, Jul 19, 2025  9:15:01 AM, Korean Standard Time.

## Task 1: Delayed Reaching Task

The folders are organized as follows :
* failed : failed to touch target
* success-lucky: succeeded in touching target but behavior is not predictive
* success-predictive: suceeded in touching target and behvaior is predictive

In each folder, the the file suffix indicates the fitness criteria used: ER/ERT/R/RT.

The md5sum is shown in the first column so that these files can serve an archival purpose.

## Task 2: Reaching Task with Input Blank-Out

The single folder contains successful cases. The prefix has two parts: 
1. visibility threshold (25/50/75/100), and 
1. network type (FFN/RNN).

The md5sum is shown in the first column so that these files can serve an archival purpose.
